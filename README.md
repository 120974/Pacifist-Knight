## About the Project
This is my **very first platformer** ever made and truly a **labor of love**.  
The goal was to explore movement, level design, and challenge—without combat.

You play as a knight who **cannot fight back**. Every mistake is fatal.

## How to Play

Precision and timing are everything.
